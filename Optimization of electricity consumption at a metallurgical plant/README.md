# Optimization of electricity consumption at a metallurgical plant

**Project description:**

In order to optimize production costs, the metallurgical plant LLC "Steel Bird" decided to reduce electricity consumption at the stage of steel processing. We need to build a model that will predict the temperature of the steel.

**Project target:** 

- Find the best prediction model for the last measured temperature.

As a criterion for assessing the quality of the model, it needs to use the MAE metric. The metric value must be less than 6.6. It is necessary to consider the following classes of models: decision tree, boosting, neural networks.
- Analyze the importance of the main factors.
- For one of the identified important factors, conduct additional research:

Show a plot of the factor versus the target variable.

**Project results:**

All project goals have been achieved. All 4 models are considered. The best model was determined, the value of the metric on the test sample was 6.5. The analysis of the most important features was carried out. Visualizations built.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- CatBoost
- Matplotlib
- Phik


**Project status:** Project completed.
