There are oil samples in three regions: in each 10,000 deposits, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. It is necessary to choose the deposit with the highest volume of reserves. The number of fields depends on the company's budget and the cost of developing one well.

## Survey target

To build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit.

## Research progress

- Data review
- Data preprocessing
- Train and validate the model
- Calculation of profit and loss hazard
