**Project description:**

Oil company G is looking for a location for a new oil well. There are oil samples in three regions: in each 10,000 deposits, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. It is necessary to choose the deposit with the highest volume of reserves. The number of fields depends on the company's budget and the cost of developing one well.

**Project target:** 

Based on geological exploration data, select an oil production area.

**Project results:**

The risks of oil production in each region are determined, the best region is selected. The average profit in the best region was calculated. The confidence interval for the average profit is calculated.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Bootstrap
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

**Project status:** Project completed.
