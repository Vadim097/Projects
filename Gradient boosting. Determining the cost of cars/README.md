# Determining the cost of cars. Gradient boosting. 

**Project description:**

A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Based on historical data (technical characteristics, equipment and prices of cars), it needs to build a model to determine the cost of the car.

**Project target:** 

Build a model with an minimum RMSE-measure.

**Project results:**

During the study, 3 algorithms of the gradient boosting library were tested: CatBoost, LightGBM and XGBoost. Several models with different hyperparameters were built on each library. Then models were created on several simple algorithms such as: linear regression and random forest. Comparison of models is carried out and the best is chosen. The best models trained on the test set and calculated RMSE.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Catboost
- Lightgbm
- Xgboost

**Project status:** Project completed.
