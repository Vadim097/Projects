# Protection of clients of the insurance company

**Project description:**

Insurance company "X" wants to protect customer data. It is necessary to develop a method of data transformation so that it is difficult to recover personal information from them.

**Project target:** 

- Check the hypothesis. The features are multiplied by an invertible matrix. The quality of the linear regression will not change.
- Suggest a data encryption algorithm. Program this algorithm using matrix operations. Check that the quality of the linear regression from sklearn is the same before and after the transformation by applying the R2 metric.

**Project results:**
The hypothesis was tested through a data encryption algorithm that describes this hypothesis. Then the model was compared before and after encryption. The models were compared using the R2 metric.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy

**Project status:** Project completed.
