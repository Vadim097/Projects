# Forecasting the number of taxi orders for the next hour

**Project description:**

The Accurate Taxi company collects historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, it needs to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.

**Project target:** 

Build the best model. The *RMSE* metric on the test set should not exceed 48.

**Project results:**

During the project, an exploratory data analysis was performed, additional features were generated, three models were built (linear regression, fully connected neural network and gradient boosting). The best model is determined, RMSE is calculated, conclusions are given.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Skorch
- Catboost
- Torch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn


**Project status:** Project completed.
