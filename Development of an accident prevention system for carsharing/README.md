**Project description:**

A car-sharing company is developing a system that could predict customer-caused accidents along a given route. Accidents are accidents with any damage to the vehicle. After the driver has booked a car, got behind the wheel and chosen a route, the system should give a forecast. If the system predicts an accident, the driver will see a warning and route recommendations. The idea of ​​creating such a system is at the stage of preliminary discussion and elaboration. There is no clear algorithm of work and similar solutions on the market yet. The current task is to understand whether accidents can be predicted based on the historical data of one of the regions.

**Project target:** 

Develop a model that will help predict the guilt of the car-sharing driver.

**Project results:**

During the project, was performed exploratory and statistical data analysis, was built the best model that predict the guilt of the car-sharing driver. F1 measure and roc-auc were chosen as quality metrics. The importance of features affecting the accident rate was also determined and recommendations were made to reduce the influence of these features.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Scikit-learn
- Skorch
- Catboost
- Torch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Statistics

**Project status:** Project completed.
