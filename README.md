Forecasting the Bank's customer churn |Clients started leaving the bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Provided historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.                                                    | Scikit-learn Pandas Matplotlib
Forecasting the cost of housing in a residential area. |The service for the sale of apartments ordered the development of a model for predicting the cost of an apartment | Spark Pandas Python
Hotel Sales Forecasting System |A model for predicting the cancellation of a client's reservation is built. As a metric, it is proposed to use the amount of revenue that will be obtained after the implementation of the machine learning model.                    | Python Scikit-learn Pandas Matplotlib Numpy Exploratory data analysis
A study of data from the Yandex. Music service - a comparison of users of two cities | Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week. Petersburg is a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow. Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Business must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. Using real Yandex.Music data, you will check the data and compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.                                                  | Python Pandas
Determination of a favorable tariff for a telecom company | A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, analyzed the behavior of customers when using the services of the operator and recommended optimal sets of services for users. Pre-processing done data, their analysis. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and difference in revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions.                         | Data processing, Histogram, Boxplot, Statistical test, Student's criterion
Sale of apartments in St. Petersburg - analysis of the real estate market | Based on the Yandex.Realty service data, the market value of various types of real estate objects, typical parameters of apartments, depending on the distance from the center, were determined. Data preprocessing has been carried out. Added new data. Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots are constructed.                                         | Data processing, histogram, boxplot, scatter matrix, categorization, scatter plot, fraud monitoring
Development of an accident prevention system for carsharing | Based on historical data from the database, identify the causes of accidents and create a safe driving alert.                                                                                      | Databases, feature synthesis
Determination of the most profitable oil production region | Oil samples were provided in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. It is necessary to build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. | Regression, business model development, bootstrap
Forecasting the number of taxi orders for the next hour | The taxi company has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model is built for such a prediction. | Time series, regression, predictions
