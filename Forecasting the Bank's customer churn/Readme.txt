# Bank customer churn

**Project description:**

Clients started leaving the bank. Every month. Few, but noticed. Bank marketers considered that the main customers are cheaper than attracting new ones.
It is necessary to predict whether the client of the bank will leave in the near future or not. Provided historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.


**Project target:** 

Build a model with an extremely large F1-measure

**Project results:**

During the project, data was pre-processed, and a method for filling gaps using machine learning was tested. 2 models are implemented: logistic regression model and random forest model. In each of these models, three methods of class balancing have been tried. The f1 measure is chosen as the quality metric. The final model has a roc-curve.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy

**Project status:** Project completed.
