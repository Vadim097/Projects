**Project description:**

Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:

/- Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
/- Petersburg is a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow.
Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Business must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. On the real Yandex.Music data, it needs to check the data and compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.
     
**Project target:** 

Check 3 gypothesis:
1. Users activity depends of day of the week. Moreover in Moscow and St. Petersburg this looks different.
2. On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Also, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

**Project results:**

During the project, an exploratory data analysis was carried out, all three hypotheses were tested, and conclusions were drawn.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas

**Project status:** Project completed.
