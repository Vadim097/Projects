# Forecasting the cost of housing in a residential area

**Project description:**

Service for the sale of apartments tempered the development of models for predicting the cost of an apartment. This project indicate median cost of housing in California in 1990. The project considers two linear regression models with different feature sets. A comparison of models was made and the best one was determined. The project implements a distributed computing approach based on the Hadoop ecosystem, namely Apache Spark.


**Project target:** 

Choose the best model and make predictions on the test set.

**Project results:**

The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and two linear regression models. Model quality metrics are RMSE, MAE and R2. A random model was built. Was made a comparative analysis of the quality metrics of working models with a random model. Conclusions are drawn.

**Stack:**

- Python 
- Pandas
- Pyspark
- Numpy

**Project status:** Project completed.
